I'm Eduardo Teixeira de Souza.

I'm triplet and my project can be found in [github.com/Lkledu](https://github.com/Lkledu){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;

I'm doing technology in digital games degree. I try dev gameplays with cool mechanics who are attractive and challenger. I change my course who was of technology in information security, because I like more of programming besides infrastructure.

I'm dev in some sort of thinks like android (with java, my mother will cry when she know), C\#, C++, Angular (i'm starting, be cool). I like things like network and database too (postgres fanboy).
