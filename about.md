I'm a IT student who feel the necessity to share my knowledge.  
I graduated on game development technological college in FATEC Americana.
My expertises are in Java, Android Native with Java, Angular, SQL, PostgresSQl, Computer Network, and other staffs.

I'm using [theme's documentation](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to write this blog, cause I don't wanna lost time creating css files, or doing pagination scripts to have a blog for share posts.
