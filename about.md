I'm a IT student who feel the necessity to share my knowledge.
I'm in the least year of the game developer technological course in FATEC Americana.
My expertises are in C#, Android Native with Java, Angular, SQL, PostgresSQl, Computer Network, and other staffs.

I'm using [theme's documentation](https://rohanchandra.github.io/project/type/) with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to write this blog, cause I don't wanna lost time creating css files, or doing pagination scripts to have a blog for share posts.
