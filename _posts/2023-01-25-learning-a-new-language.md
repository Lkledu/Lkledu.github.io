Long time since I posted anything in here. New year, new goals. Since december 2022 I started thinking in how to learn a new language.
I was trying to learn russian, it's not a complicated language (the basic part), but as I don't found any interesting content on internet that motivate me to keep learning it, I just stopped while I've learned just the alphabet and some random words and phrases (I'm not even in the elementary level). After that I begin to try learn Chinese. Chinese has lots of contents on internet, Chinese people produce a lot of content like posts, videos, meme, games, donghua, poems, songs, and so on. So I guess it will be useful to be able to learn chinese, but the amount of content needed to start is bigger than other languages, and I will discuss about it.

While I was thinking on how approach was the best to learn a new language, I pounder about how I learned english, how was to study portuguese on highschool, and what I saw while I was trying to learn Russian. Every language has characteristics in common that can lead us to a path to fluency.
From the start, after we choose a language to study, we need to see what kind of language is this, by this I mean, if the language uses an Alphabet or symbols for the words, if it has any particularity about it that can be saw as a particular characteristic of that specific language (Russian changes the way that O is pronounced if it is the tonic silab or not, chinese has five tons to spell sounds). After knowing it, it will lead us to our first task, **lern the alphabet**
