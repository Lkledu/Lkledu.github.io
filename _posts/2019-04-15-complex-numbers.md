When we talk about complex numbers, it's necessary to talk about numbers in general. Numbers are values to express quantity or quality. They can be divided in groups like, Natural numbers (1,2,3,4,5....) thats are the first group that we learn in school. 

After, we learn about integers and we get a little confused in how can a number be smaller than zero. But we get some familiarity it then and go on. We learn about the set of rational numbers and their fractions, and finally we reach the real numbers with their decimal values. After this whole trip we think that we understand numbers in their complitute and we start to study functions, but when we look to quadratic functions, sometimes we get a value like $$ \sqrt{-1} $$ and our teacher say to us that it's not have a solution. After that we take knowledge about the imaginary and complex numbers, but anyone try to explain that to us (sometimes because their doesn't really know too).


##### Not so complex
The imaginary number i is the first complex number we meet. It's represented as the $$ \sqrt{-1} $$ what doesn't explain anything about complex numbers but get easy. This representation are of a complex number with the set of a real number, if we want to understant the number i, we need to represent it as a complex.
The complex form of i is (0,1), what means a real part equals to zero and a imaginary part equals to one. What it's this imaginary part? Well, try to think about numbers in a line, we acctually call that line the "real line" (cause the set of real numbers are disposed in there). If we had a value zero, it'll be in the origin of that line. A value -1 will be in the left side of the line, and 3,1415... will be in right side of the line. Our i number has a real part equals to zero, what means it's in the origin of the real line. Now, think of another line intersecting this first line in the zero point, making a right angle. We can call this second as the imaginary line. The number i has a imaginary part equals to 1. Know if you try to draw this, you will see that looks kind of familiar like a cartesian plane, with the x axis representing the real line, and y axis representing the imaginary line, and i is in (0,1) coordinate. This show to us, that the complex numbers are a set of numbers out of the number line, it's the first set without 1D.

But for be possible to exist a new set of numbers, it's need to accept the aritimetic operations like sum, multiplication, subtraction and division.

Two of that operations are easely demonstrated, and the others are only the inverse.

### SUM
we can sum to complex numbers like we do with coordinates. if we had two xy coordinates, first we sum the x part, and after we sum the y part. It'll result in a new xy coordinate:

        (a,b) + (c,d) = (a+c, b+d)
        (1,2) + (3,4) → (1+3, 2+4) = (4,6)

that's can be done with the a+bi complex representation too (this is only a new way to represent the same number).

        1+2i + 3+4i → (1+3) + (2+4)i = 4+6i

### MULTIPLICATION
for multiplication it's a bit different. We need to do an operation following the rule:
-given two (a,b) and (c,d) complex numbers
-we multiply the real parts with each other, and do the same with the imaginary part. Like this:
        (ac - bd) + (ad + bc)

Following this rule we can proof that i² = -1:

$$
        (0,1) * (0,1) \linebreak
        (0*0 - 1*1) + (0*1 + 1*0) \linebreak
        (0 - 1) + (0 + 0) \linebreak
        -1 + 0 \linebreak
        -1 or in the complex form (-1,0) \linebreak
$$

ploting this in a cartesian grid, we can see that, multiplying the real part of a number has the property of scaling this value, but multiplying the imaginary part, will turn 1/4 clock wise that number in the grid.

it's possible to do those same operations with rational numbers, we only need to remember that rational numbers also are complex numbers, but with the imaginary part equals zero (a+0i or (a,0)).
