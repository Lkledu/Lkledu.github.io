This is my first dev blog, where I will post some kind of articles about what i'm studying.

I'm a programmer in Brazil, who likes of data structure and your implementations. I'm father of two kittens too, who are sisters.

##### Why Jerkyll?

I don't want to lost time writing html files, structuring my Js libs and editing css.

My intention is only share what I'm learning. If I spend time with this other things, I'll lost productivity.

Jerkyll is a statical site generator, very well for blogging. It's create the whole structure of folders and files and deploy using github pages. He use markdown files for posts, whats possible for the writer to focus on the writting insted of worry with technology issues like html tags.

##### Why CloudCannon?

Perhaps you don't know, but I'm using [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/)as my CSM for help me create, editing and deploy contents. It's free and attends my necessities.
