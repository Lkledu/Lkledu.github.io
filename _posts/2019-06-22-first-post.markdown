This is my first dev blog, where I will post some kind of articles about what i'm studying.

##### Why Jerkyll?

I don't want to lost time writing html files, structuring my Js libs and editing css.

My intention is only share what I'm learning and how I'm learn. If I spend time with this other things, I'll lost productivity.

##### Why CloudCannon?

Perhaps you don't know, but I'm using CloudCannon as my CSM for help me create, editing and deploy contents. It's free and attends my necessities.
